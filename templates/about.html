        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m a pre-final year engineering student with a strong passion for software development, innovation, and building solutions that matter.</p>

        <p>I've actively participated in national-level hackathons and tech competitions, and I’m proud to have won the <strong>Best Societal Patent</strong> award at a hackathon. I currently have <strong>two more patents</strong> in progress, focused on addressing real-world challenges through scalable tech.</p>

        <p>Beyond competitions, I’ve taken part in several workshops and seminars, including <strong>Manthan, Cyber Security</strong>, which broadened my understanding of cutting-edge technologies and industry expectations.</p>

        <p>What drives me is the opportunity to combine creativity with code. I love collaborating in teams, thinking critically under pressure, and turning raw ideas into working products. I’m especially passionate about full-stack development, clean tech, and ethical software systems.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to grow into a well-rounded software developer who not only builds robust applications but also contributes to societal progress through meaningful innovations.</p>
