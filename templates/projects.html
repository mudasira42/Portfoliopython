        <h2>My Projects</h2>

        <h3>1. Hotel Management System</h3>
        <p>
            A Java-based desktop application that manages hotel bookings, check-ins, and billing operations. 
            It connects seamlessly with a SQL database using JDBC for real-time data access and updates. 
            This project helped me understand database integration and object-oriented programming in depth.
            <br><em>Tech Stack:</em> Java, JDBC, MySQL
        </p>

        <h3>2. SentinelChain</h3>
        <p>
            An AI-powered threat detection system integrated with blockchain to ensure decentralized, tamper-proof cyber threat intelligence.
            SentinelChain uses machine learning models to identify potential cybersecurity risks and records them immutably on a local blockchain for transparency and traceability.
            <br><em>Tech Stack:</em> Python (ML), Solidity, Hardhat, JavaScript
        </p>

        <h3>3. Skills Sync</h3>
        <p>
            A smart job discovery platform that analyzes user resumes and matches them with suitable job opportunities based on skills, decency filters, and location preferences. 
            The platform aims to enhance job relevance and reduce application mismatches using simple filtering and logic-based analysis.
            <br><em>Tech Stack:</em> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
        </p>

        <h3>4. Real-Time News Aggregator</h3>
        <p>
            A web app that fetches and displays real-time news from multiple sources using public APIs. 
            Users can filter by category (like technology, health, business) and stay updated on global events.
            <br><em>Tech Stack:</em> JavaScript, NewsAPI, React, Tailwind CSS
        </p>

        <h3>5. AI Chatbot using LLaMA and Streamlit</h3>
        <p>
            A local chatbot interface powered by Metaâ€™s LLaMA model, deployed using Streamlit for an interactive frontend. 
            The bot can handle general queries and showcases the use of lightweight, local language models for conversational AI. 
            This project helped me explore large language models outside of cloud-based APIs.
            <br><em>Tech Stack:</em> Python, LLaMA, Streamlit
        </p>
